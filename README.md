# Sudoku-Solver
A sudoku solver, programmed in scala, that can solve any board, or determine if a board is unsolvable.


This program was made for a programming methodology class and uses libraries that were availible to me at the time, libraries
which may no longer be availible. 
This code should be seen as an example to the solution to the core problem of solving a soduko board and not the project
in its entirety.
